*"You are an expert website designer, brand strategist, and SEO specialist specializing in high-converting portfolios for professional writers. I already have a portfolio at https://anirudhsaini1600-cmyk.github.io/, but I want you to rebuild and improve it as a fully designed, single-page, no-code portfolio website. The site must be clean, modern, mobile-friendly, and optimized for both SEO and client conversion. Required Changes In the Guestpost section, replace the 'View' CTA button for the CDM blog with 'Read'. Remove these portfolio items entirely: Short URL blog Role of IT Infrastructure The Future of Digital Transformation Penetration Testing Lift and Shift Cloud Migration How Does a VPN Work Add a new dedicated section for 'Newsletters & Landing Pages' showcasing 2–3 sample projects with descriptions. Gap Improvements to Apply Replace all vague CTAs with action-oriented, benefit-driven CTAs. Expand the About Me section with storytelling, credibility markers, and niche positioning. Ensure service descriptions clearly outline benefits, outcomes, and client impact. Improve visual hierarchy: better spacing, typography contrast, and image balance. Add 2–3 testimonials that highlight results, reliability, and working style. Place micro-CTAs at the end of each section. Implement SEO best practices: keyword-rich headings (H1, H2, H3), optimized meta title and meta description, descriptive image alt text. Add subtle hover effects and animations for interactivity. Site Sections Hero Section – Name, tagline, professional headshot placeholder, and a keyword-rich value proposition in 1–2 sentences. About Me – Engaging, story-driven bio combining personal journey + professional credibility. Services Offered – Blog Writing, SEO Articles, Social Media Copy, Newsletters, Landing Pages (each with client-focused benefits). Portfolio – Only best-fit, high-impact samples (after removals). Guestpost Section – Updated CTA to 'Read'. Newsletters & Landing Pages Section – New, visually distinct section with mockups and benefit-driven descriptions. Testimonials – 2–3 quotes. Call to Action – Compelling invite to collaborate. Contact Section – Contact form, email, LinkedIn, social links. Design Guidelines Color palette: soft neutrals + 1 bold accent color for CTAs. Typography: modern, easy-to-read fonts. Layout: minimal, spacious, conversion-focused. Subtle animations and hover effects to guide interaction. Content Tone Matching Add-On Analyze the writing style, tone, and phrasing in my current portfolio at https://anirudhsaini1600-cmyk.github.io/. Match this style throughout the new site so that: The tone feels personal yet professional. Sentences are concise, confident, and reader-friendly. Word choice reflects my unique voice as a content writer, not generic marketing copy. Maintain my style in About Me, service descriptions, portfolio captions, and CTAs. Make the site read as if it’s crafted by me personally — authentic, polished, and client-attractive."*
